# WhatsApp Integration Setup Guide

## 📱 WhatsApp Web Integration

The website now uses WhatsApp Web.js to send messages directly from the server to your WhatsApp number.

### 🔧 Setup Process

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Scan QR Code**:
   - When the server starts, you'll see a QR code in the terminal
   - Open WhatsApp on your phone
   - Go to Settings → Linked Devices → Link a Device
   - Scan the QR code shown in the terminal

3. **Authentication**:
   - After scanning, you'll see "✅ WhatsApp client is ready!" in the terminal
   - The WhatsApp client will now be authenticated

### 📋 How It Works

1. **User submits demo form** on the website
2. **Server sends email** to your configured email address
3. **Server sends WhatsApp message** directly to your WhatsApp number
4. **You receive both notifications** instantly

### 🔍 Troubleshooting

#### QR Code Issues:
- Make sure your phone has internet connection
- Try refreshing the QR code by restarting the server
- Make sure you're using the same WhatsApp account

#### Authentication Issues:
- If authentication fails, delete the `.wwebjs_auth` folder and restart
- Make sure 2FA is enabled on your WhatsApp account

#### Message Not Received:
- Check if the WhatsApp client shows "ready" status
- Verify the phone number in .env file is correct
- Check server logs for any error messages

### 📞 WhatsApp Number Format

Make sure your WhatsApp number in the .env file is in the correct format:
```
WHATSAPP_NUMBER=918147768993
```

**Important**: 
- Include country code (91 for India)
- No spaces or special characters
- Must be the same number you use to scan the QR code

### 🔒 Security Notes

- The WhatsApp session is stored locally on your server
- Only you can access the WhatsApp client
- Messages are sent directly from your server to your WhatsApp
- No third-party services involved

### 🚀 Production Deployment

For production, consider:
- Using WhatsApp Business API for more reliable delivery
- Setting up webhook notifications
- Implementing message queuing for high volume
- Adding message delivery status tracking
